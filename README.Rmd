**NOTE: This is a toy package created for expository purposes, for the second edition of [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org). It is not meant to actually be useful. If you want a package for factor handling, please see [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org).**


# foofactors

Factors are a very useful type of variable in R, but they can also be very aggravating. This package provides some helper functions for the care and feeding of factors.

## Installation

You can install the released version of testgitaction from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("testgitaction")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("chriszheng2016/testgitaction")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# comment to make render readme.md since testgitaction
# doesn't exit
#library(testgitaction)

## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
